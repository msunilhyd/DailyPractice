Maps : 

1.Diff between HashMap and LinkedHashMap
   = LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order of the entries. HashMap does not.

2.Diff between HashMap and HashTable
	= HashTable is synchronised and does not allow null keys or values.
	  HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.

3.Diff between HashMap and TreeMap
	= TreeMap does not use Hashing to store objects but Red Black Trees.
	  Keys in TreeMap are always sorted.

4. Diff between ArrayList and LinkedList
	= ArrayList stores objects using the array data structure. Linked List stores the objects in a doubly linked list.
	  Generally it is preferred to use ArrayList over LinkedList due to the cost reductions of operations by ArrayList.


Object Class in Java :
	Object class is in java.lang package and it sits on the top of the class hierarchy tree.
	Some methods that are inherited from the object class are :
	1.protected object clone() = creates and returns a copy of the object.
	2.public boolen equals() = returns true if this object is equal to some other object.
	3.protected void finalize() = is called by the garbage collector when it determines that there are no more 
		references to this object.
	4.public final Class getClass() = returns the runtime class of the object.
	5.public int hashCode() = returns the hashCode value of the object.
	6.public String toString() = returns the string representation of the object.
	7.notify(), notifyAll(), wait(), wait(long timeOut), wait(long timeOut, int nanos)

OOPS:
1.Abstraction = Hiding the details of the implementation from the user. Ex : A Java program as it converts complex instructions 
				into machine code.
				It can be achieved through inheritance.

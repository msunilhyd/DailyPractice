HTTP Protocol : 

1. Similar to other protocols as SMTP and FTP, but there is one fundamental difference : 
   HTTP is a stateless protocol. which means  that http supports only one request per connection.
   This means the client connects to the server to send one request and then disconnects.
   This mechanism allows more users to connect to the server over a period of time.
   
 2. The client sends a HTTP request and the server answers with an HTML page to the client, using HTTP.
 3. POST is used to CREATE and PUT is used to update.
 4. Calls to PUT are idempotent. Sending the same POST requests twice creates 2 resources.
